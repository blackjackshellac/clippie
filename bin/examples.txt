Keep quiet the principal just passed away!...
Blue is the definition of purple squared by green and so 2/5=the square root of 43 of the 6th shade of purple on the minor side of the scale with a flaw of 56% of yellow and 34% green meaning that if you were so blue you were greener than purple you are practically saying you are so blue your almost yellow which still makes no sense but anyway I am very happy I just spent 2 hours working that all out lol By the way I'm 11 years old!
Oh my god it's so funny but confusing just think about it really hard but here's one
How's your youngest hair mines doing mighty fine today!
You are the wisest man in the world...NOT. Haha I was just kidding you are cool...NOT. Okay I am going to tell the truth you are awesome.
This is as good as the zebra who was purple but it got eaten by the orange spoon that was more of a purpler orange than a triangle.
Laugh out loud totally awesome, whoever came up with that must be really clever. I'm seriously still loling I'm gonna use this
This literally made me and my friend burst out laughing. This is the funniest thing ever, it definitely deserves number 1.
Ha! Actually, for Halloween, my friend didn't want to dress up so she brought a cereal box that was 'stabbed' and called herself a cereal killer.
One question and one question only... WHY
Hilarious, poor goldfish crackers
I translate that
Look out! the cat-grapes are attacking!
Pancakes are 7, so it must 42 of them to reach life multiplied by Saturn, so 7/Saturn must equal the moon. Using this theory, we can calculate that the meaning of life is not 42, but blue. Using this new info, and using the unicorn theorem, we find that the amount of pancakes used to get to the moon, is exactly 1.462423847927948372947234 headlights.
With the headlights on? I'd approximate as many grains of salt it takes to change a lightbulb on a month of Sundays, although I cannot get an exact number because the tree did NOT fall in the woods.
My colleague basically ignored me so I asked him the question, needless to say I had his full attention and the reply "what did you just ask me? "
Here's a variation: "If you're kayaking up a tree and the wheels fall off how many pancakes does it take to get to the moon? " "Purple, because snakes don't have elbows."
Short and sweet! LOVE IT! Two words that are completely random and had me laughing for 2 minutes straight. There is also nothing that would offend anyone.
Now whenever I get tounge twisted or forget my words in front of a big crowd I can just say banana error. It'll certainly take all the attention off of the mistake.
I am going to yell this in class and everyone will be laughing and crying because it was so beautiful!
This sounds like something that I would just scream out in the middle of a busy shopping Centre
